# Minesweeper

A classic Minesweeper game implemented using Pygame.

## Installation

1. Install Python 3 and Pygame library.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

1. Run the `run.py` script to start the game.
2. Use the left mouse button to open tiles and the right mouse button to mark tiles as mines (flags).
3. The game has different difficulty levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Ruby) that can be selected from the GUI.
4. The game automatically saves the current state and loads it when the game is restarted.

## API

The main game logic is implemented in the `game.py` file, which includes the following classes:

- `Game`: The main game class that handles the game loop, user input, and game state management.
- `Timer`: A class that executes an event after a specified time interval.
- `create_count_tiles`: A function that creates the tile images for the mine counts.

The `board.py` file contains the `Board` class, which represents the game board and handles the game logic, such as opening tiles, marking mines, and detecting game over conditions.

The `gui.py` file includes various GUI elements, such as `Label`, `Button`, `SelectionGroup`, `Input`, and `InputDialogue`, which are used to create the game's user interface.

The `leaderboard.py` file contains the `Leaderboard` class, which manages the high scores for each difficulty level.
